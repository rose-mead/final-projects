### [Swopsies](https://swopzies.herokuapp.com/#/)

Goods and services are expensive... why not offer a way for the community to come together and trade skills, knowledge and home baked goods.

This is an app for people to list goods and services that they need, or want to share within their community. It is aimed at people of all demographics, whether it's someone who is retired and offering their services in their spare time, or a busy young professional wanting someone to walk their dog.

The hope is to provide a platform for people who are wanting to trade their skills and crafts, but don't have money in mind while doing so. Who doesn't like a good old barter??
